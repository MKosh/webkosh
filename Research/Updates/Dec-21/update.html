    <ul>
      <li>Updated plotting functionality and plotted MVA responses:</li>
      <p>Added a "genPlots" function that can take in an xml file with the plotting function arguments and plotbased   on that. It also saves the plots in an appropriate folder/file. A new folder gets created every new daythat the  plotting function gets used. This will help me keep old plots just in case, without having to run asorting  script like I was doing. It should speed up plotting and make it easier.</p>
      <p>I used that functionality to plot the MVA method responses. Two of the methods, BDT and DNN_GPU are shown tothe right. The other two methods, Fisher and MLPBFGS had similar shapes to the BDT and DNN_GPU respectively.The separation isn't great for any of the methods. I could get TMVA's signal and background comparison plots, they look nicer and don't separate the background processes, but I have to rerun the training again and stop it before it goes to the application phase. Shouldn't take long, I just have to actually find the time to do it.</p>

      <li>I played around with the "optCutScan" function. It loops over the MVA output and looks for the highest significance value. The significance can be 
        <ul style="font-size: larger; ">
          <li>sgf0: \(eff \times \pi \)</li>
          <li>sgf1: \(\frac{s}{\sqrt{s+b}}\)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
