      <li>I made another set of control plots using the BDT>0.028 cut. The MC events are an order of magnitude lower than it was with the cut based selection, and the data is an order of magnitude higher than the cut based selection. You can see those in the first set of plots. I also made a set of plots using both the selection cuts and the BDT cut, and got the plots on the second set of plots. These both look much worse than the cut based selection alone. Since I applied the preselection cuts (the SR cuts) to the MC samples before the training even happened the max amount of background + signal for the MC samples is ~7500 events. Those 7500 events are what got passed to the output file. Any extra cut applied (different than just the SR cut) will take the MC event counts even lower than the 7500. But the data will not necessarily go low enough to match the MC samples. Because all ~7x10^6 data events got directly passed to the output file, it's starting from more events and the BDT cut alone doesn't bring it down to the same order of magnitude as the MC samples. But the BDT cut does bring down the MC samples even lower than the 7500 events that they start with. Hence the high data event counts, and low MC sample event counts for the first set of plots.</li>
